To run program, simple run the command in terminal: 
python3 covid_content_stats.py

Be sure that both spike.fasta and fullgenome.fasta are in the same directory.
Two additional files are also produced by this program: xvalues.txt and
yvalues.txt. These files contain the data for the graph and are just separated
so I could easily copy and paste the data into a google spreadsheet. With all
the data in the google sheet, I simply produced a scatterplot based off this
x and y data.
